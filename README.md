# Introduction
Home Assistant is an open-source home automation platform that allows you to monitor and control various aspects of your home, such as lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. I'm using Home Assistant for several years now and I'm sharing my setup and configuration for inspiration purposes for others. And I'm also using this repository as a to-do list for the few things I (still) need to fix or add to the setup :smile:

All detailed information about my setup is stored into the wiki:
